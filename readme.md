# Question Answering System Front End

A front end for the Question Answering System built on Twitter data for an Information Retrieval Course.

For the backend service, we made use of a Flask API built on top of Solr for indexing the tweets. The Flask source code can be found at : https://github.com/monisjaved/Tweet-QA-System
